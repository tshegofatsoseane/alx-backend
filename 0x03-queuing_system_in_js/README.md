# Project: Redis Server and Queue System with Node.js and Express

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Explain how to run a Redis server on your machine.
2. Describe how to perform simple operations with the Redis client.
3. Demonstrate how to use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
4. Illustrate how to store hash values in Redis.
5. Outline how to handle asynchronous operations with Redis.
6. Discuss the usage of Kue as a queue system.
7. Build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server.
8. Build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server and queue.

## Requirements

- All code will be compiled/interpreted on Ubuntu 18.04, using Node.js 12.x, and Redis 5.0.7.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should use the `.js` extension.

## Getting Started

### Running a Redis Server

To run a Redis server on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Redis on your system if you haven't already done so.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory where Redis is installed.
4. Run the Redis server by executing the command `redis-server`.

### Running Simple Operations with the Redis Client

To perform simple operations with the Redis client, such as setting and retrieving values, follow these steps:

1. Install the Redis client for your programming language of choice.
2. Connect to the Redis server using the client library.
3. Use commands provided by the client library to perform operations like `SET`, `GET`, etc.

### Using a Redis Client with Node.js

To use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations, follow these steps:

1. Install the `redis` npm package using `npm install redis`.
2. Require the `redis` module in your Node.js application.
3. Create a Redis client instance and connect to the Redis server.
4. Use the client's methods to perform operations like `set`, `get`, etc.

### Storing Hash Values in Redis

To store hash values in Redis, follow these steps:

1. Use the Redis client to perform hash-specific operations like `HSET`, `HGET`, etc.
2. Specify the hash key and field when performing hash operations.

### Dealing with Async Operations with Redis

To handle asynchronous operations with Redis, follow these steps:

1. Use promises or async/await syntax when interacting with the Redis client.
2. Ensure proper error handling for asynchronous operations.

### Using Kue as a Queue System

To use Kue as a queue system, follow these steps:

1. Install the `kue` npm package using `npm install kue`.
2. Require the `kue` module in your Node.js application.
3. Create a Kue instance and configure it as needed.
4. Use Kue's methods to create, process, and manage jobs in the queue.

### Building a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server

To build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server, follow these steps:

1. Set up an Express application.
2. Connect to the Redis server using the `redis` module.
3. Define routes and handlers to perform Redis operations within your Express app.

### Building a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server and Queue

To build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server and queue, follow these steps:

1. Set up an Express application.
2. Connect to both the Redis server and Kue queue using the respective modules.
3. Define routes and handlers to interact with Redis and the queue within your Express app.
